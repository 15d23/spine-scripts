# Spine scripts

This GitHub project hosts scripts to export images from Adobe PhotoShop, Illustrator, and other image editing tools for use in [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com). In addition to exporting images, some scripts also write JSON data which can be [imported into Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-import#Data). This brings the images into Spine with the exact positions and draw order they had in the image editing software, which can greatly reduce the effort needed to initially set up a skeleton or skin.
